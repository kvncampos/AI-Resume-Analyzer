# Reason for This Project

The AI Resume Analyzer project was born out of a desire to solve real-world problems. Here's why I created this:

### 1. Personal Motivation
As someone passionate about technology, I wanted to build a tool that:
- Helps job seekers refine their resumes.
- Assists recruiters in evaluating candidates more efficiently.

### 2. Gaps in Existing Tools
Many resume analyzers exist, but few:
- Provide actionable feedback.
- Are accessible to everyone.

### 3. Skill Development
This project was also an opportunity to:
- Improve my skills in Python, Docker, and AI.
- Learn and use new libraries like `langchain`.

## Long-Term Vision
The goal is to make this tool robust enough to be used in professional recruitment processes. Features like resume scoring, keyword suggestions, and detailed analysis are in the pipeline.
